<body>
This describes how to set up a project using the new build scheme. This is a living document,
and we will need to update it as we gain more experience with Ivy. 

<h2>Some assumptions:</h2>
<ol>
<li> Your project is a set of Rhythmyx extensions (and related code). </li>
<li> You have dependencies on other third party (e.g. Apache) JARs </li>
<li> Your project may or may not be re-used by other projects. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Dependencies and the Build process.</h2> 

<p>In the past, we referenced Rhythmyx JARs via Eclipse "User Libraries". 
These libraries had different names on different machines, and no two developers
did things the same way. 
In addition, third party JARS were placed in the /lib folder, which means that each
project could be using different sets (and potentially different versions) of these same JARs. 
Projects with dependencies on other code (such as the PSOToolkit) frequently contained obsolete 
versions of the dependent JARs.   
We're going to replace all of this with Apache Ivy.</p>
<p>Ivy will retrieve (by means of Ant tasks added to the build.xml) all of the Rhythmyx 
and third party JARs that your project declares as dependencies.  It will place the JARs
in a /ivylib folder, and the build script (and your Eclipse java builder) will use
these JARs to compile your code. </p>
<h2>Setting up</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Apache Ivy - From the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy">Ivy Ant Website</a>. 
The current version is the 2.0 Beta release, but we will use the 2.0 production when released. </li>
<li>Set your Eclipse Ant preferences.  The "Ant Runtime" must contain the Ivy Jars</li>
<li>Edit your build.xml to contain the Ant targets shown in the build.xml of this sample project.</li>
<li>Edit the ivy.xml to describe your project and list its dependencies.</li>
<li>Make an ivy-local.properties (based on ivy-local.sample.properties) which reflects how you connect to
the Ivy repository on  
<a href="http://foo.percussion.local/ivyrepo">Foo.percussion.local</a> </li>
<li>Execute the "ivy-retrieve" target, which should extract all of the dependent jars. </li>
<li>In the Eclipse project properties, add all of the JARs in the ivylib folder to 
the .classpath</li>
</ol>

<h2>Ivy Repository</h2>
<p>Although there are various public repositories of JARs, we have chosen to make a local 
repository, which is hosted on foo.percussion.local.  We did this for a number of reasons, 
but most important was that we get to control what versions of the third party JARs are available.
We put the repository on Foo because everybody who develops code should already be using the 
Subversion code library, and has access to Foo.</p>
<p>As you can see from clicking on the link, the repository is just a directory of files, served by 
the Apache web server.  The XML files (called "ivy files" in the Ivy documentation, describe the modules, 
the "artifacts" (jars) which comprise them). The master 
<a href="http://foo.percussion.local/ivyrepo/ivysettings.xml">settings</a> file gives the layout of the repository.
There is also an XSLT stylesheet that renders the ivy files in a pretty format.</p>
<p>If your project will produce JARs used by other projects, you should use Ivy to publish your JARs.
Uncomment the "ivy-publish" target and make sure that your SFTP connection info in ivy-local.properties is 
up to date, and you should be all set.  <i>Note: the ivy-publish target must be run separately from the main build target.</i></p>
<p>If your project needs third party jars which are not in the repository, you may add them.   The minimum requirements are: 
<ol>
<li>An Ivy descriptor with organization name, module name, revision, and the list of jars included.</li>
<li>The directory structure must follow the pattern in the settings file.</li>
<li>If these JARs are already used by Rhythmyx or JBoss, you should use the same revision.</li>
<li>All files you add to the repository should be world readable, and writable by the "pso" group.</li>
</ol>
The descriptor does not have to be elaborate, but the more accurate you can make the dependencies, the better.  
You should also include a reference to <a href="http://foo.percussion.local/ivyrepo/ivy-doc.xsl">ivy-doc.xsl</a>
</p>
<h2>What to put in Subversion</h2>
<p>Make sure that your Subversion project includes ALL of the following items: 
<ul>
<li>Source Code</li>
<li>Build files (properties files, XML files, etc.)</li>
<li>Ivy files, including ivy-local.sample.properties</li> 
<li>Unit test classes and source data for unit tests.</li>
<li>The distribution zip file (which you expect to deliver to the customer).</li>
</ul>
Some projects 
put the generated JARs in Subversion as well, but this is probably not necessary, since
these JARs are already in the zip file.
</p>
<p>
It's also important to note what you should <b>NOT</b> put in Subversion: (these should be in .svnignore)
<ul>
<li>.project</li>
<li>.classpath</li>
<li>ivy-local.properties</li>
<li>bin or classes files</li>
<li>apidoc / javadoc files</li>
<li>all dependency JARs, including the ivylib folder</li>
<li>log files and other output generated by the unit tests.</li>
</ul>
When converting an existing project, you should remove all files <b>except</b> JARs that you generate from 
the /lib subdirectory. All other JARs must come from the Ivy repository, even if you have to add them yourself.
<i>Note that the PSExtensionInstallTool requires a /lib subdirectory to operate correctly.</i>
</p>
<h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
<h3>Configurations</h3>
<p>Most projects which publish to the repository will need at least 2 configurations: 
<ol>
<li>A "default" configuration
that contains the generated JARs and dependency JARs which are needed at runtime. </li>
<li>A "test" configuration that also needs the dependency JARs for unit testing. </li>
 </ol>
 Projects which run outside of the Rhythmyx server might well need more configurations, depending
 on how they are executed (and what JARs are needed to execute them in different circumstances).
 The sample ivy.xml shows how to specify which dependencies go with each configuration.
 </p> 
<h3>Integration Builds</h3>
<p>Projects with a lot of dependencies may need to publish integration builds, so that tests of 
the dependent projects aren't tied to a release build of the library project. These projects must publish
with a status of "integration", and dependency revision will be "latest.integration". 
The JAR names should end with "-SNAPSHOT.jar" to indicate that this is an
integraion snapshot build. Ivy can be configured to recognize this pattern and check the timestamp 
of these JARs every time, even if the revision has not changed.</p>
